1. 
problem: the back distance sensor kept giving wrong inconsistent readings when the distance is larger than 30 inches. 
solution: raise back distance higher to prevent the light bouncing back from the disk on the floor. 
also use the while loop to get a true distance reading.

2. 
problem: pause after slide before turning to shoot.
solution: wait 3 seconds before the auton for the inertial sensor to calibrate. 

3.
problem: turnwest does not turn fully to west.
solution: wait 800 msec for the inertial sensor to settle down before turning.

4. 
problem: trouble aligning with the second roller to roll.
solution: slow down the drive and slide to be more accurate.
todo: use side distance sensor to set slide distance.

5.
problem: the indexer got bend.
solution: the rubber guide on the side need to be longer to cover the whole length of the shooting ramp.

field setup: check field perimeter as well as high goal placment
improvement: make the ring holder taller to hold 3 disks.
